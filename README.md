`sil` is a graphical status display for [Gefolge](https://github.com/dasgefolge) events, usually displayed at the event using a projector connected to a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/). It is intended to replace an existing project, which was closed-source and based on [info-beamer](https://info-beamer.com/).
